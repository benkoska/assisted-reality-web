# Assisted Reality

Assisted Reality is an experimental project that blends useful information directly into the user's vision and audio using AR glasses. It uses OpenAI tools and a Next.js web interface to provide seamless on-the-go assistance.

## Features
- **Real-time translation** to help you communicate across languages.
- **Person and place identification** so you can quickly recall someone's name or where you met them.
- **Extensible architecture** for adding new voice- and vision-based assistants.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Provide your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` (copy `.env.sample` as a starting point).
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
